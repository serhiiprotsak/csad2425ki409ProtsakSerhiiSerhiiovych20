# Project Title: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Server

## Repository Details
This repository contains the implementation of a **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Server** that handles multiple client requests, determines the game outcome, and returns the results. The project is developed using Python for server-side logic, with testing and coverage reporting implemented to ensure code reliability.

## Task Details
- **Task Description**: Implement a Rock-Paper-Scissors game server that receives client inputs, processes the game logic, and returns the outcome (win, lose, or draw). Additionally, a testing framework is implemented to verify the functionality of the server, with reports on test coverage and results.
- **Task Goals**:
  - Create a game server using Python.
  - Implement unit tests using a testing framework (such as `unittest` or `pytest`).
  - Generate test coverage reports to ensure code quality.
  - Expand on hardware integration and new features in future tasks.

## Student Details
- **Student Number**: 20 
- **Name**: SerhiiProtsak
- **Task Assignment**: Variant 20 RPS/JSON

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries**:
  - **Flask (or similar)**: To handle server requests and responses.
  - **Unittest/Pytest**: For unit testing and coverage reports.
- **Testing Tools**: Coverage.py for generating test coverage reports.

## Hardware Used in Future Tasks
In future tasks, the project will incorporate hardware such as the **ESP32 microcontroller**, enabling integration with embedded systems. The **ESP32** will handle sensor data and communicate with the server for more advanced interactions.
